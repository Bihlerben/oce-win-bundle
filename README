oce-win-bundle is a redistribution of open source libraries required to fully build OCE on windows.

Note that this is just a bundle of existing libraries, so please read the LICENSE for each library before continue.
Note also that this is not meant to be a complete build environment for the included libraries. At the moment, the 
Cmake files are just "made to work" , many paths are hardcoded or GLOBbed , and the quality level is at the minimum
required to use the libraries with OCE.

REQUIREMENTS:

CMake 2.6 or greater
Visual Studio 2008 or greater (better if SP1)


BUILDING:

To build the bundle you just need to run Cmake against the project lib.
It is suggested to do out-of-source builds.

For example, run a MSVC command prompt and type

mkdir C:\<YourBuildDir>
cd C:\<YourBuildDir>
cmake C:\<oce-bundle-source-dir>

at this point open C:\<YourBuildDir>\oce-win-bundle.sln

Build both for Debug and Release.

Once built, you need to explictly compile the INSTALL target, one time in Debug and one time in Release.
This last operation will copy the required includes, libraries and binaries to the installation directory.

The predefined install directory is C:\oce-win-bundle\
If you want to change it, you can use cmake-gui
